"""
Given a sorted array of integers, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
Your algorithmâ€™s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].
Example:
Given [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]
and target value 8,
return [3, 4].
